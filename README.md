## Generative models, patchs methods, computational photography

This course is divided into two parts.

The first part focuses on two key tools in image restoration and editing: patch-based methods and generative neural networks. Patch-based methods rely on the assumption that local neighborhoods in digital images (patches) exhibit self-similarity properties that can be exploited to enhance image quality. Generative networks (autoencoders, generative adversarial networks) enable image improvement or synthesis based on training on large datasets.

The second part covers several applications from the field of computational photography, which aims to overcome the limitations of imaging devices through algorithmic means. The two methodological approaches introduced earlier are applied in this context.

Detailed applications include:
- High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging
- Image deconvolution
- Inpainting
